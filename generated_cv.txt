I have been working in the field of mobile development for over a year. My
experience is in developing mobile applications for mobile devices. In this
project I have developed a mobile application that is based on a database of
database tables. The application is designed to be a simple
web application with no interaction with any database. It is also designed
to be able to use the database to create a user profile. This
app is available for download on my website.  I also have a project for
developing a web app for Android.
